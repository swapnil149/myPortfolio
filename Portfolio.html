        Web programming captivated me with its potential to transform ideas into tangible online experiences 
        like creating dynamic and interactive websites, making it an exciting field to explore and excel in.
        I wanted to take this class to enhance my knowledge and skills in web programming and software development. 
        Technology has always fascinated me, and the opportunity to engage in the creative process of building
        interactive websites is truly exhilarating. Prior to this class, I have gained a practical experience
        working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I am enthusiastic about expanding my expertise in these areas. 
        Additionally, I have also dabbled in Python, C, and C++, further broadening my programming skill set.

     <h3>Favorite Food and How I Enjoy It</h3>
     <img height = "100" width = "100" src = "Images/Malai_Kofta.jpeg" align="left" />
     <p>An image of my favorite food (Malai Kofta) is shown on the left. Malai Kofta is a homemade croquette 
        with potatoes, paneer and chopped vegetables dipped in a vegetable cream sauce and cashew nuts. 
        It is often garnished with fresh cilantro leaves and served with naan bread, roti, or rice.
        The gravy for Malai Kofta is made using a combination of tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, and 
        a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. 
        Cashew paste or heavy cream is added to give the gravy its creamy and luxurious texture. 
        The koftas are gently placed in the gravy just before serving, allowing them to soak up the flavors.
        I absolutely love indulging in this dish, especially when it's served with a side of garlic naan. 
        The flavors blend harmoniously, creating a mouthwatering experience that leaves me craving for more.
        This dish is a favorite among vegetarians and is commonly enjoyed at special occasions, festivals, and in Indian restaurants worldwide. 
        Its aromatic flavors and creamy texture make Malai Kofta a truly satisfying and decadent culinary experience.
