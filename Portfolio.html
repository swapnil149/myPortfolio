        Web programming captivated me with its potential to transform ideas into tangible online experiences 
        like creating dynamic and interactive websites, making it an exciting field to explore and excel in.
        I wanted to take this class to enhance my knowledge and skills in web programming and software development. 
        Technology has always fascinated me, and the opportunity to engage in the creative process of building
        interactive websites is truly exhilarating. Prior to this class, I have gained a practical experience
        working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I am enthusiastic about expanding my expertise in these areas. 
        Additionally, I have also dabbled in Python, C, and C++, further broadening my programming skill set.
